## Python File Integrity Monitor

### Project Overview
This project implements a File Integrity Monitoring system using Python.
It detects unauthorized file changes by comparing current file hashes against a trusted baseline.
The project demonstrates core defensive security concepts used in SOC environments.

### Project Objective
* Demonstrate hands on understanding of file integrity monitoring.
* Show how baseline driven hash comparison detects malicious or unauthorized changes.
* Practice a SOC style monitoring and alerting workflow using Python.

### Security Capabilities Demonstrated
* File integrity monitoring fundamentals.
* Baseline creation and validation.
* Detection of file modification events.
* Detection of file creation events.
* Detection of file deletion events.
* Practical defensive security logic.

### How It Works
* The tool scans a target directory.
* It generates SHA-512 hashes for each file.
* It stores these hashes as a trusted baseline.
* It continuously monitors the directory for changes.
* It compares current file hashes against the baseline.
* It alerts when differences are detected.

### Detected Security Events
* Modified files
* Newly created files
* Deleted files

### Environment
* Operating system Kali Linux
* Programming language Python 3
* Hashing algorithm SHA-512

### Project Structure
* baseline.txt stores trusted file hashes
* fim.py main monitoring script
* Target directory monitored for file changes

### Usage
* Run the script.
* Select option A to collect a baseline.
* Modify files inside the Target directory.
* Run the script again.
* Select option B to start monitoring.
* Observe real time detection alerts.

### Screenshots and Evidence

### Potential Improvements
* Log security alerts to a file for audit and review.
* Implement ignore rules for specific file types or directories.
* Add configuration file support for flexible deployment.
* Integrate email or webhook notifications for alert delivery.
